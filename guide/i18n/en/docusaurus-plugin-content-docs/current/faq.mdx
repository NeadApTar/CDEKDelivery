    <summary>What algorithm is used to determine dimensions for price calculation in cart</summary>

    Sort parameters below in ascending order: height, width, and length.

    Now follow these steps for each product:

    read dimensions

    sort dimensions in ascending order

    if there is more than one product, multiply smallest dimension of product by number of products and sort resulting
    values

    Now compare respective values (i.e., smallest with smallest, medium with medium, greatest with greatest) from
    settings and from products, and select greatest of them.

    Example: there is order with following products:

    * product 1 (10 \* 12 \* 15) 1 pc
    * product 2 (5 \* 20 \* 10) 3 pcs
    * product 3 (7 \* 3 \* 25) 1 pc
    Dimensions specified in settings are (12, 12, 12)

    The following values will be compared:
    ~~~
    (12, 12, 12)
    (10, 12, 15)
    (10, 15, 20) ( 15 = 5 * 3, multiply smallest side by number of products and sort again)
    (3, 7, 25)
    ~~~

    As a result, order will be calculated with these dimensions: 12, 15, 25.
