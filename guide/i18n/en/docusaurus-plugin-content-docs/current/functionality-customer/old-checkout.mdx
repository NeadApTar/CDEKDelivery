# Shortcode Checkout

This page describes how plugin works with the classic shortcode checkout.

<details>
<summary>How to understand what kind of checkout am I using?</summary>

You can check the checkout type in the admin panel. See our [guide](/functionality-customer/checkout-versions) for more
    details.

After adding goods to the cart, you will find delivery options with various rates and prices on the order creation page.
Here you can also change the delivery address, and the price will be recalculated.

For "to warehouse"/"to parcel terminal" rates, **Choose pick-up** button will appear.
Clicking the button will display a map with pick-up points.

<Image img={require('./img/button.png')} />

:::warning

Depending on you theme, position of checkout blocks may vary.
But, basically, the map button should be located near the delivery options.

Selected pick-up point will be displayed next to the **Re-select pick-up** button

<Image img={require('./img/pickup.png')} />

:::warning

The procedure above is valid for old Wordpress checkout version. The new checkout has a different map representation.
Please refer to the [new checkout guide](/functionality-customer/new-checkout) for more details.
