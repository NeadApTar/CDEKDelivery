# Block Checkout

This page describes how plugin works with the new block checkout.

<details>
    <summary>How to understand what kind of checkout am I using?</summary>

    You can check the checkout type in the admin panel. See our [guide](/functionality-customer/checkout-versions) for more
    details.

</details>

With the new checkout, delivery options are displayed below a delivery address after its input.

<Image img={require('./img/new.png')} />

There is no pick-up point selection button for "to warehouse" delivery methods;
in case of such method, map will be displayed below delivery methods rather than in pop-up window.

<Image img={require('./img/map.png')} />

:::warning

The procedure above is valid for new Wordpress checkout version. The old checkout has a different map representation.
Please refer to the [old checkout guide](/functionality-customer/old-checkout) for more details.
