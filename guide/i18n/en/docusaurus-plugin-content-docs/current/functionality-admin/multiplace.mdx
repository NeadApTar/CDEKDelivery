# Multi-seater mode

With enabled Multi-seater mode, products from the same order can be packaged in several packages with different sizes.

In addition to choice of package size on the order page in the admin panel, there will be a choice of products and number of products to be in this package.
Product quantity that can be added to package is limited to the number of these products in order.
If five pieces of Product 1 are added to the order and three of them are added to package 1 of Product 1, then only two units of that product can be added to package 2 (i.e., remaining undistributed product units).

Once all the products are distributed into packages, a list of packages with their dimensions and contents will be
displayed.
Clicking Create Order will create an order in the CDEK system and you will get the order â„– and an
invoice link in response.
You can check the package number column to ensure that several packages have been created.
